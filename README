This is project is a test if a web-account plugin for Aperture 3.2 is possible.

It's called "Paul" for no reason but to give it a name.

Either place the Paul.accountconfigplugin in /Applications/Aperture.app/Contents/Plugins or make 
this folder writeable to your user. The build process will place the product in that folder and
start Aperture.

This is currently only the first part for a plugin. A web-account plugin is splitted in two parts.
First the .accountconfigplugin package and the .publisher package. This code deals with the 
.accountconfigplugin part only at the moment.
