This is project is a test if a web-account plugin for Aperture 3.2 is possible.

It's called "Paul" for no reason but to give it a name.

Either place the Paul.accountconfigplugin in /Applications/Aperture.app/Contents/Plugins or make 
this folder writable to your user. The debug build process will place the product in that folder 
and start Aperture.

This is currently only part 1 of 2 for a plugin (it seems). A web-account plugin is splitted 
into two parts. First the .accountconfigplugin package and the .publisher package. This code 
deals with the .accountconfigplugin part only at the moment.
